Don't just read books! Try listening to stories from PDF.

Greeting from Lakshmikanth Rajamani,
I use to read lot of books and thought to automate the process with a handy principle. Then, I got to know the services provided by Audible, Storytel and explored their services and thought it would be bit costier for students. So came up with a solution of converting a pdf file available in the market (https://www.pdfdrive.com) to speech, where they can upload a link of the pdf file or locally available pdf file and get converted into audio file. which can be downloaded and used for listening the stories.
